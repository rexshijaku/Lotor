Make sure all packages are installed after you clone this repo.

Go to Lotor/lotor_input and Lotor/lotor_output (analyze these folders)

Urls (domains) you need to crawl should be added on seed.txt on Lotor/lotor_input folder

Important : 

input files stopword and albterms are not complete (due to copyright reasons)
